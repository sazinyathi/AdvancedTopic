Delegates is an object that knows how to call a method.
Why do need a delegates because can be call by each other.
Delegates allows us to applications that flexible and  extensible.
For this framework it is not extensible meaning if other Developer wants to apply another Photo filter.
He cannot able do it by introducing Delagates we can make this code be more extensible.
The old way of initializing a Delegate will be show 
public Delegate void PhotoHandler(Photo photo);
From the client we also call the above Delegate by initailizing first like below
PhotoProcessor.PhotoHandler filterHandler = filters.ApplyBrightness;
Action => for a method that does return a value
Func<> => for a method that return value.
Using a Generic Delegate we can improve the code above to be more simply
Action<Photo>
